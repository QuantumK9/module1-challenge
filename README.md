# Module 1 Challenge

## Description

This is a challenge for the end of the first week of the Trilogy Front End Web Development Bootcamp. 

This challenge was started and almost completed during an online practice session within a team of 4 learners. 
The purpose of it was to try and refactor existing html and css files, in order to improve the final product's accessibility. 

In more detail, there was an effort to use semantic html elements with a logical structure, descriptive and concise title, 'alt' attributes in img elements and meaningful names of classes. In the css file, code was also refactored to have minimum amount of classes and be organised in a more sequential order.
